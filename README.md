Week 1: Recall the machine learning and python.
- Sample task to learn about jupyter markdown notebook.
- Learned GitHub using Data Camp Platform. 

Week 2: Recall of regression techniques and new way handling the model in Regression.
- Generating data set after data handling operation on original dataset.
- Applying Predictive modeling on generated and split data set.

Week 3: Learned and applied Support Vector Machines with different kernels, Logistic regression recall.
- Recall logistic regression and applied on cancer data set and Airbnb for predicting.
- SVM model implemented from using SKlearn package and tested in on dataset.
 
Week 4: Decision tree and machine learning data camp course.
- Recall and learned new way methods of handling and using the Decision tree on different data set.
- using Airbnb dataset on decision tree data model we analysis the how data set really work on model.

week 5: Decision tree using hypermeter tuning, Ensemble Techniques.
- Using hyper parameter tunning in decision tree and handing ensemble techniques .
- Implemented new way of handling data cleaning before applying the model on dataset.

week 6: Text Mining Classifications
-Using code lemmatization, applied Latent Semantic Analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) on news data set.
-Applying corpus word on the dataset, on dataset applied CountVectorizer to get good result for model understanding.

week 7: Recall and new techniques in Neural Networks
- applying Neural networks NN om the handwritten data set MNIST machine learning.
- Taking real world data obesity dataset from INTERNET, applied different data handling technique for cleaning and applied neural networks
- from Obesity data set we analysis that type of obesity that its effects classification in NN.

week 8: Learning and implementing Deep Neural Networks from TensorFlow. 
- Set up the TensorFlow environment in anaconda for deep learning concepts
- Using keras API creating the dense layer, build the sequences and g=hidden layers
- Applied the Deep neural networks on handwritten data set.

week 9: Convolutional Neural Network.
- Applied the deep neural networks on obesity data set to check how best results the model giving when comparing with svm and decision tree.
- CNN Classification - Keras - Working with image files data set about apples and detecting the images in test data result.

week 10: Recurrent Neural Networks.
- RNN Sequence classification model on basketball data set, analysis of the model.
- RNN Time Series model on weather data, analysis of the model.
- Taking Dell data set from financial yahoo and predicting the 10th day of the stock market using RNN

week 11: Autoencoders.
- Applying the autoencoder on handwritten data set MNIST data set. check the how model working on images and analyzing them.
- Creating new images using kleick with 28*28 size and take same 5 images and add to the MNIST dataset.
- Replicate the image data set and apply the autoencoder and save the model.

These topics helped me a lot and learned real world data science concepts from this Course.
