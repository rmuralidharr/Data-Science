This is a bit of a 'red flag' to indicate that the precision of our model may be poor - which is most likely due to the imbalance between classes in our training data (480 in one class and 4520 in the other). Such imbalances can be a problem with many machine learning algorithms, including k-nn. Addressing this problem is a topic for another class, but the influence of the unbalanced data can be partially mitigated by using a smaller k value. We will see this in practice when we cover hyper-parameter tuning in the next class.\n",

    "Universal Bank's initial promotional campaign offered 5000 existing customers a loan product. Of the 5000 targeted, 480 accepted the offer. Since the cost of targeting a customer is \\\\$10 and the profit from getting a customer to take the loan is \\\\$100, this initial trial resulted in a loss of \\\\$2,000. If this 'null model' approach were used on the remaining 50,000 customers, this would result in a loss of \\\\$20,000. \n",

    "Based on the expected performance of the proposed model, Universal Bank could proceed with implementing a profitable campaign. But, the data shows a significant imbalance as there are far more customers that didn't take the offer than did. if we could reduce the negative effect of the unbalanced data set, there is an opportunity to develop a better performing model. (as a reminder, a 'perfect' model would produce a profit of $432,000.00 - though we can't expect a perfect model to be found, there is significant room for improvement).  \n"
